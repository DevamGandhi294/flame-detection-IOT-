# ABOUT THE PROJECT

Flame Detection and Alert System using Arduino, Flame Sensor, and Buzzer
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple flame detection and alert system using an Arduino Uno, a KY-026 Flame Sensor, and a buzzer. The system is designed to detect the presence of fire or flame and immediately trigger a buzzer as an alert.

Components Used:
Arduino Uno
KY-026 Flame Sensor
Buzzer
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
External USB Power Supply
How It Works:
The KY-026 Flame Sensor detects the presence of a flame or fire.
When a flame is detected, the sensor sends a signal to the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino Uno then triggers the buzzer, providing an audio alert to notify of the fire hazard.
The system continuously monitors the sensor for flame detection and automatically resets once the fire is no longer detected.
Key Features:
Real-time flame detection using the KY-026 sensor.
Immediate buzzer alert for fire hazards.
Simple and efficient setup for home or office safety.
Easy-to-replicate hardware connections and Arduino code.
Applications:
This project can be used in small-scale fire detection systems for homes, offices, or workshops where a quick alert is needed in case of fire.

Instructions:
Connect the KY-026 Flame Sensor and buzzer to the Arduino Uno as per the provided circuit diagram.
Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino Uno.
Power the system and test by introducing a small flame near the sensor.
The buzzer will sound when the sensor detects the flame.
